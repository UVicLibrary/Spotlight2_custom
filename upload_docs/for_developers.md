### Create a Spreadsheet for Spotlight

Because Spotlight and Solr (the software that saves and indexes the metadata) need the metadata field names structured a certain way, we now need to transform a copy of our cross-walking document into something Spotlight can read.

1. *Preview: download a template spreadsheet.*

  In Spotlight, go to **Dashboard > Items** (under Curation) **> Add items > Upload multiple items > Download template** (see image below). The final spreadsheet will follow this format.

2. *Open your crosswalk document in Excel and save as a new workbook, e.g.* "spotlight_for_upload.xslx."

3. *Export as a CSV*

### Plop the Files

### Upload the CSV to Spotlight

### Troubleshooting

#### Improperly escaped strings

#### Excel messes up dates

#### Spaces in spreadsheet or file path
